Clinic Hypertension Follow-Up Protocol

Purpose
This protocol describes a simple approach for follow-up and medication adjustment in adults with elevated blood pressure seen in the outpatient clinic. It is intended for educational and testing purposes only and does not replace clinical judgment.

Initial categorization

Normal blood pressure: systolic < 120 mmHg and diastolic < 80 mmHg.

Elevated blood pressure: systolic 120–129 mmHg and diastolic < 80 mmHg.

Stage 1 hypertension: systolic 130–139 mmHg or diastolic 80–89 mmHg.

Stage 2 hypertension: systolic ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg.

Follow-up schedule

Elevated blood pressure: reinforce lifestyle changes; repeat visit in 6 months.

Stage 1 hypertension without major cardiovascular risk factors: start or intensify lifestyle changes; consider medication; follow up every 3 months until blood pressure is controlled on two consecutive visits.

Stage 1 hypertension with high cardiovascular risk, or Stage 2 hypertension: start or adjust medications and lifestyle changes; follow up every 1 month until blood pressure is controlled on two consecutive visits, then extend visits to every 3–6 months.

Home blood pressure monitoring

Encourage patients to check blood pressure at home several days per week, preferably at the same time of day, and bring a log to clinic visits.

If home readings are consistently above target, consider earlier follow up or medication adjustment.

Treatment adjustments

If blood pressure remains above target at follow-up, assess adherence, lifestyle factors, and side effects.

Adjust medication doses gradually or add another class of antihypertensive drug as appropriate for comorbidities.

Reassess laboratory tests and secondary causes of hypertension if control remains poor despite multiple medications.

Emergency thresholds

If a patient has very high blood pressure with concerning symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or neurologic deficits, advise immediate emergency evaluation rather than routine clinic follow-up.

Documentation

At each visit, document blood pressure values, medication list and changes, lifestyle counseling, and planned interval to next visit.
